# Obel2d

Obel2d is a tower defense game made **entirely** in sdl2.

I use [this json parser](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for writing map data to json.
It is very easy to use.

## reviews
Obel2D is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. I love the puzzles and the challenge it provides. I have never been able to put it down for more than a few minutes.
